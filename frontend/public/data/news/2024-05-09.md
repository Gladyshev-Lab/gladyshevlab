# Nature of epigenetic aging from a single-cell perspective

We are pleased to announce that our manuscript is now published in Nature Aging.

We evaluate the contributions of stochastic and co-regulated components to single-cell epigenetic and transcriptomic aging in mice.
Over 10 years ago, precise epigenetic clocks predicting human age were developed, however, the mechanistic explanation for their work was not fully clear.
