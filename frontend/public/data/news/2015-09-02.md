# SPS Publication Makes Cover of September’s Genome Research

Yesterday, the Genome Research September issue was released much to the delightful surprise of our colleague, Dr. Marco Mariotti. The [September cover](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/9.cover-expansion) features artwork painted by Dr. Mariotti’s mother, Milena Biolcati Rinaldi. The cover illustration was inspired by the concepts of Mariotti et al’s SPS paper, which is published in the September issue.

More information on the SPS publication can be found [here](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/9/1256.abstract).
