# Graduate Student Researcher Receives Ph.D. Degree

Congratulations are in order to Mikalai Malinouski, graduate research student in the Gladyshev lab since August 2005, for completing and successfully defending his Ph.D. thesis earlier this season. Under the guidance of Dr. Gladyshev and Dmitri Fomenko, Ph.D., Mikalai graduated with a Ph.D. in Biochemistry at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on May 6, 2011.<br/>
Mikalai’s Ph.D. thesis is entitled, “Understanding of Selenium Utilization and Redox Homeostasis Through Imaging and High-throughput Approaches.” During his Ph.D. course work, he was able to publish 3 papers and was also involved in various projects, including: studying the transportation and regulation of trace elements in human cells and tissues; developing a high-throughput method for ionomic profiling in mammalian cells; detecting new genes involved in trace element metabolism and identified candidate genes that uniquely regulate metabolism of particular trace elements.<br/>
We are also happy to announce that Mikalai will continue to further his research on thioredoxin reductases and selenoproteins as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Gladyshev lab.
