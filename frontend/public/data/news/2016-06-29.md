# Summer Lab Outing to Mt. Major

The lab’s annual summer outing this year was a hike on Mt. Major. Atop the summit, the lab enjoyed a guitar serenade by postdoc Marco, singing Happy Birthday (in French!) to postdoc Adeline, and enjoying the spectacular view of New Hampshire at 544 meters high! The day-trip concluded with ice cream to cool-off from the intense hike and heat.
