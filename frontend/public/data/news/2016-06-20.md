# 11th Annual Symposium on Aging

Last Friday, Dr. Gladyshev was invited to speak at the 11th Annual Harvard/Glenn Symposium on Aging. Every year, the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging hosts the Harvard Symposium on Aging at Harvard Medical School. The mission of the symposium is to educate the wider research community about advancements in this fast-paced field and to stimulate collaborative research in this area.

Following the symposium, Dr. Gladyshev was gifted the Paul F. Glenn Aging award (pictured above) by the Center’s Co-Directors, Drs. Bruce Yankner and David Sinclair, along with the President and Director of the Glenn Foundation for Medical Research, Mark R. Collins.
