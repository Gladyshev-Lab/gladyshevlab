# Apple-picking at Shelburne Farm

Some member’s of the lab took a Sunday drive to the outskirts of Boston to enjoy a wonderful sunny day apple-picking at Shelburne Farm. For one grad student, this was the first time experiencing such an outing, and therefore, truly enjoyed this fall New England tradition.
