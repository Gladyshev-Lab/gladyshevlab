# MFA Thesis Art Exhibition

Members of the lab went out to support Vadim’s wife, Helen, in her completion of her MFA from the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. Helen, along with other fellow graduates, exhibited their thesis for an entire week at MassArt. Members of the lab were very impressed at her self portraits and sculptures, particularly at the fact that she has only been sculpting for a short time. The entire lab would like to congratulate Helen in her achievements. We are excited to see what she will do next.
