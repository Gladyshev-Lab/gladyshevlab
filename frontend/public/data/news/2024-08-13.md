# Thrilled to share our latest paper in Nature Aging!

We uncovered how aging drives mouse B cell lymphoma development via c-Myc activation, promoter hypermethylation, and somatic mutations. These changes lead to the expansion of age-associated clonal B cells (ACBCs) and increased biological age.

ACBCs thrive independently, support malignancy in young recipients, and shorten lifespan. Excitingly, longevity interventions in old mice reduced these pre-malignant changes!

While mouse and human B cell lymphomas differ, the epigenetic changes we observed in mice align with those in humans, suggesting potential intervention strategies.
