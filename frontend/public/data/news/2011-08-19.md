# Post-doc Receives an Ellison/AFAR Fellowship Award in Aging

Vyacheslav Labunskyy, Ph.D. has been chosen as one out of fifteen postdoctoral fellows in the country to receive the 2011 Ellison Medical Foundation/AFAR Postdoctoral Research in Aging Award. The Ellison Medical Foundation created the award, in partnership with the American Federation for Aging Research (AFAR), “to encourage and further the careers of postdoctoral fellows with outstanding promise in the basic biological and biomedical sciences relevant to understanding aging processes and age-related diseases and disabilities. The award is intended to provide significant support to permit these postdoctoral fellows to become established in the field of aging.”<br/>
Dr. Labunskyy’s project seeks to better understand the link between endoplasmic reticulum stress and aging, using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. Results of his research may have broad implications for many age-related diseases associated with aberrant folding and accumulation of misfolded proteins and may provide a rational basis for new therapeutic strategies to delay the aging process in humans.
