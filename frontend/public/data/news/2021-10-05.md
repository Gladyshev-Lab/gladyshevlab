# Our paper on the genetic links between COVID19 and aging is published!

Our new study, published in [Communications Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-021-00033-z), reveals that genetic variation that supports longer life is significantly associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization. We also find an interesting link between COVID and the Notch signaling pathway. Congrats to graduate student Albert and everyone involved!
