# Grad Student Successfully Defends PhD Thesis

Siming Ma, a graduate research student in our lab, successfully defended his thesis titled, “Molecular Patterns and Signatures of Longevity” today. Siming joined the lab in April 2012 as a graduate student of the Harvard Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS) PhD program. For his thesis research, Siming developed and used bioinformatics tools to analyze the variation of gene expression, metabolites and elements across different species of mammals, flies and yeasts, to identify the molecular patterns associated with species natural lifespans. During this time, he published 3 papers as first author and 6 papers as contributing author. Following his graduation, Siming will join the Genome Institute of Singapore to focus on cancer biology. Congratulations Dr. Ma!
