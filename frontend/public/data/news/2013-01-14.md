# Postdoctoral Fellow Receives NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00)

In October of 2012, Vyacheslav Labunskyy, Ph.D. was awarded a prestigious K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) to support his research on the role of the unfolded protein response in aging. Dr. Labunskyy’s research interests include the basic mechanisms of aging and understanding the biological processes that underlie age-related diseases. In his studies, Dr. Labunskyy uses a combination of genetic, molecular and biochemical approaches to characterize the mechanisms by which ER stress response signaling regulates longevity and how protein folding capacity and redox state in the ER change with age in the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.
